# Describe your project,
A webapp that tracks which famous people are going to the different World Wonders

# Your motivations behind it,
I am an avid traveler and like to think about famous people having been to similar places that I am visiting. With this app I can see exactly which famous people have been there before/after me. I will also include the address and a hotel suggestion for the famous people so it is easier to "bump into them".
